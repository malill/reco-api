# Recommendation API - Wiki

This repository provides a REST API that exposes calculated recommendations from a **Recommender Builder**. Recommended
items can then be consumed by a recommendation slider carousel to show recommendations.

Note that the project structure is based on
[ycd/manage-fastapi][ycd] and [tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql][tiangolo].
